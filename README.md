## React Weather App

## Motivation

I built this application because I wanted to learn more about using React. Specifically, I wanted to learn about using APIs with React. 

## How to use
You can use this application by visiting the app and entering a city and country into the form fields. The application will then return the forecast for that location. 

## Tech/framework used

This application was built with React and bootstrapped using Create React App. You can learn more about Create React App here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app. It also utilizes the OpenWeather API and NPM. 

## OpenWeather API

This application utilizes the OpenWeather API. This API is a beginner-friendly tool that can be used to return weather forecasts. You can find the OpenWeather guide here: https://openweathermap.org/guide. The documentation for OpenWeather can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api.

You can use OpenWeather to pull a variety of weather information including:
    -Current weather data
    -5 day/3 hour forecast
    -16 day/daily forecast

See documentation for more info!

    -Node.js/NPM (see: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
